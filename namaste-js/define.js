// console.log(a)
// var a;
// console.log(a)
// var a = 7;  

// if (a === undefined){
//     console.log("a is undefined")

// else {
//     console.log("a is not undefined")
// }

//  JavaScript is a loosely type language
// eg:

var a;
console.log(a);

a = 10;
console.log(a);

a = "hello world";
console.log(a)

// here it logs out 3 of them even they have same variable. 
// Thats why js is called loosely type language, strong at the same time.

// an unhealthy practice in a js is :
a = undefined;
console.log(a)
// because undefined is a placeholder given in the JS itself. 
// so need to define it again. It's considered as a bad practice.
